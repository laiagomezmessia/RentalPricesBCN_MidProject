## Data Sources
The project utilizes data from the Barcelona City Council's open data portal:
- [Average Monthly Rental Prices](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-mercat-immobiliari-lloguer-mitja-mensual)
- [Number of Rental Contracts](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/ca/dataset/est-mercat-immobiliari-lloguer-nombre-contractes/resource/951ee1a0-5105-4e8c-a459-3ef7b7cc2ed6?inner_span=True)


## Hypotheses
1. Rental prices have significantly increased over the last 10 years.
2. Consistent seasonal patterns exist in rental prices.
3. Special events, such as the pandemic, can be detected in the data.


## Data to Analyze
1. Quarterly average rental prices by neighborhood over the last decade.
2. Quarterly information on prices per square meter.
3. Quarterly data on the number of rental contracts.
